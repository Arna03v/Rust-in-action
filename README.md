# Rust-in-action
This is a practice repository which contains the code written while reading/learning chapters 5 to 12 from the book 'Rust in Action' by Timothy Samuel McNamara.

## Chapter 5
Teaches the reader about 
- Bit patterns
- Endian-ness
- Representing and dissecting decimal/floating point numbers using exponents and mantissa

### Practice 
Implementing a CPU emulator in multiple steps to establish that functions are also data
- Iteration 1 : Implementing an adder
- Iteration 2 : Looping the adder to make a multiplier, showing us an instruction can be repeated multiple times
- Iteration 3 : Implementing a stack to call and return addresses using a stack and stack pointer to execute multiple instructions

## Chapter 6
Teaches the reader about memory in Rust
- Stack
- Heap
- Dyanamic allocator
- Virtual memory
